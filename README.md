# Github Enterprise theme (Gothub)
This is the repository for the Enterprise theme for Github. It enables the theme without requiring you to move over to enterprise. That's all it is.

## What it does:
1. It adds some custom css (found in `src/inject/inject.css`) which prepares the layout and makes sure a FOUC does not happen.
1. It runs a one-line JavaScript file that adds `.enterprise` class to the `body` element.

## Why?
Because some people like black.

## Contributing
Contribute if you want, create issues if you encounter problems.
